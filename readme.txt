Test driven development

before writing any new code, we first write a failing test

tdd is
red   -->  green   -->   refactor
red - make a test that fails
green - make test pass
refactor - make code right/remove duplicacy between test file n make file
ONE TEST METHOD MUST NOT DEPEND ON ANY OTHER TEST METHOD
